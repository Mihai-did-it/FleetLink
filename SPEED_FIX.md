# Vehicle Speed Fix - Realistic 30-40 MPH Movement

## Changes Applied

### âœ… **Restored Realistic Vehicle Speeds**

1. **Base Speed**: Back to 35 mph (realistic city driving)
2. **Speed Range**: Now properly varies between 25-45 mph
3. **No Artificial Slowdown**: Removed the 10% speed multiplier
4. **Realistic Acceleration**:
   - Starts at 10 mph (acceleration from stop)
   - Reaches 35 mph during normal driving
   - Slows to 15 mph when approaching destination

### âœ… **Improved Speed Variations**

The `getRealisticSpeed` function now provides:

- **Startup**: 10 mph â†’ 35 mph (acceleration phase)
- **Normal Driving**: 25-45 mph range with natural variation
- **Approach**: 35 mph â†’ 15 mph (deceleration to destination)

### âœ… **Updated Logging Units**

- **Distance**: Converted from kilometers to miles
- **Speed**: Displayed in mph
- **Travel Distance**: Shown in feet for better understanding

## Speed Behavior

### **What You'll See:**
1. **Vehicle moves at realistic highway speeds** (30-40 mph average)
2. **Natural speed variations** throughout the route
3. **Proper acceleration** from stops
4. **Deceleration** when approaching destinations
5. **Fast but visible movement** on the map

### **Console Output Example:**
```
ðŸšš Vehicle VEH-001 simulation update:
  currentProgress: 23.45%
  speed: 37.2 mph
  totalDistance: 2.34 miles
  distanceToTravel: 15.2 feet
```

### **Delivery Detection:**
- Still uses 200-meter (656 feet) proximity
- Vehicle must get within this range to deliver packages
- Notifications trigger when vehicle actually reaches package locations

## Testing

1. **Add vehicle + packages + generate route**
2. **Start simulation**
3. **Observe**: Vehicle now moves at realistic city driving speeds
4. **Console logs**: Show proper mph speeds and mile distances
5. **Deliveries**: Still accurate based on proximity to package locations

## Benefits

- **Realistic Movement**: Vehicle behaves like actual delivery trucks
- **Proper Speed**: 30-40 mph average with natural variations
- **Visual Clarity**: Fast enough to be realistic, slow enough to observe
- **Accurate Delivery**: Proximity-based delivery detection unchanged
- **Better UX**: More engaging and realistic simulation experience

The vehicle now moves at proper delivery truck speeds while maintaining accurate package delivery detection!
