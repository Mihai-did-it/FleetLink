# 🧪 Local Testing - FleetLink

Your FleetLink application is now running in **Local Testing Mode**!

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Application URL**: http://localhost:8081
2. **Status**: ✅ Running with local mock database
3. **Features**: All functionality working without external dependencies

## 🎯 What to Test

### ✅ Add Vehicle Functionality
- Click the **"Add Vehicle"** button
- Fill in the form:
  - Vehicle ID: `TRUCK-TEST` 
  - Driver: `Test Driver`
  - Location: `San Francisco, CA`
- Click **Submit**
- ✅ **Expected**: Vehicle appears on map immediately

### ✅ Add Package Functionality  
- Click the **"Add Package"** button
- Fill in the form:
  - Package ID: `PKG-TEST`
  - Vehicle: Select from dropdown
  - Destination: `Oakland, CA`
  - Weight: `10`
  - Recipient: `Test Customer`
- Click **Submit**
- ✅ **Expected**: Package appears in vehicle details

### ✅ Route Generation
- Select a vehicle with packages
- Click **"Generate Route"** button
- ✅ **Expected**: Blue route line appears on map showing actual road paths

### ✅ Simulation System
- Click **"Start Simulation"**
- ✅ **Expected**: Vehicles change to "active" status, packages become "in-transit"

## 🔍 Verification Points

### Visual Indicators
- 🟢 **"Local Testing Mode"** badge in bottom-left corner
- 🗺️ **MapBox map** loads correctly
- 📍 **Vehicle markers** appear as colored dots
- 📦 **Package counts** update in real-time

### Console Logs (Press F12)
Look for messages prefixed with `[LOCAL]`:
```
✅ [LOCAL] Vehicle added: TRUCK-TEST
✅ [LOCAL] Package added: PKG-TEST
🗺️ [LOCAL] Geocoded address: Oakland, CA → { lat: 37.8044, lng: -122.2712 }
```

### Data Persistence
- ✅ Added vehicles persist during session
- ✅ Added packages persist during session  
- ✅ Route data is maintained
- ✅ Real-time subscriptions work

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Local Mock Database
- **Vehicles**: In-memory storage with real-time subscriptions
- **Packages**: Linked to vehicles with status tracking
- **Routes**: MapBox Directions API integration
- **Geocoding**: Real MapBox geocoding for addresses

### Sample Data Included
- 2 pre-loaded vehicles (`TRUCK-001`, `TRUCK-002`)
- 2 pre-loaded packages for testing
- San Francisco Bay Area locations

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Add Buttons Don't Work
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify the "Local Testing Mode" badge is visible
3. Check network tab for failed API calls

### If Map Doesn't Load
1. Verify MapBox token in `.env.local`
2. Check console for MapBox errors
3. Ensure internet connection for map tiles

### If Routes Don't Generate
1. Verify packages have valid destinations
2. Check MapBox API quota/limits
3. Look for geocoding errors in console

## ✅ Success Criteria

You've successfully tested when:
- ✅ Can add vehicles and they appear on map
- ✅ Can add packages and they link to vehicles  
- ✅ Can generate routes with real road paths
- ✅ Can start/stop simulation
- ✅ All data persists during session
- ✅ No console errors

## 🎉 Ready for Production?

Once local testing passes, you can:
1. Follow `SUPABASE_SETUP.md` to set up the real database
2. Update imports in `FleetLinkApp.tsx` back to `supabase-api`
3. Deploy with persistent data storage
