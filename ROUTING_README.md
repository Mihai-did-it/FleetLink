## ðŸ›  Setup Instructions

### 1. Mapbox Configuration

Your Mapbox token is already configured in the code:
```javascript
const mapboxToken = 'pk.eyJ1IjoibW5pZmFpIiwiYSI6ImNtZjM5dng3dzAxZWYybHEwdmZ2MmE4MDkifQ.CGxxP82dHH4tu6V9D6FhHg';
```

### 2. API Permissions

Ensure your Mapbox token has these scopes enabled:
- âœ… Directions API
- âœ… Maps API  
- âœ… Geocoding API (for location search)

### 3. Usage Limits

**Free Tier:** 50,000 requests/month for Directions API
**Monitor usage:** Check your Mapbox dashboard regularly

## ðŸ“‹ How to Use the Routing System

### Step 1: Add Vehicles and Packages

1. Click **"Add Vehicle"** in the navigation
2. Enter vehicle details and starting location
3. Click **"Add Packages"** to assign delivery destinations
4. The system will automatically geocode addresses to coordinates

### Step 2: Generate Routes

1. Navigate to the **"Routing"** section
2. Click **"Show Routes"** to enable route visualization
3. Click **"Optimize All Routes"** to generate delivery routes
4. Routes will appear as colored lines connecting all delivery points

### Step 3: Monitor Deliveries

1. Click on any vehicle marker to see detailed route information
2. Hover over checkpoint markers to see package details
3. Track progress through the route management dashboard

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features in Detail

### Route Optimization
- **Multi-waypoint routing:** Handles up to 25 delivery stops per vehicle
- **Mapbox Directions API:** Uses real road networks for accurate routes
- **Distance/Time calculation:** Provides realistic delivery estimates

### Visual Features
- **Route Lines:** Color-coded paths showing the complete delivery route
- **Checkpoints:** Numbered markers for each delivery location
- **Interactive Popups:** Detailed information on hover/click
- **Real-time Updates:** Routes update automatically when packages change

### Route Management
- **Route Statistics:** Total distance, estimated time, number of stops
- **Vehicle Routes List:** Overview of all active delivery routes
- **Route Controls:** Easy toggle to show/hide routes on the map

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Core Files Added/Modified

1. **`src/lib/routing.ts`** - Mapbox Directions API integration
2. **`src/AppWithRouting.tsx`** - Enhanced app with routing capabilities
3. **Route visualization logic** - Map rendering and checkpoint system

### API Integration

```typescript
// Example: Create a delivery route
const deliveryRoute = await createDeliveryRoute(
  vehicleId,
  startLocation,
  packageDestinations,
  mapboxToken
);
```

### Route Data Structure

```typescript
interface DeliveryRoute {
  vehicleId: string;
  startLocation: RouteWaypoint;
  waypoints: RouteWaypoint[];
  destination: RouteWaypoint;
  routeGeometry: any;       // GeoJSON geometry
  duration: number;         // Total time in seconds
  distance: number;         // Total distance in meters
}
```

## ðŸŽ¨ UI Enhancements

### New Navigation Section
- **"Routing"** tab added to the main navigation
- Route control buttons (Show/Hide Routes, Optimize All)
- Real-time route statistics display

### Enhanced Vehicle Details
- Route information in the vehicle drawer
- Waypoint list with estimated arrival times
- Route generation button for individual vehicles

### Interactive Map Elements
- **Vehicle markers:** Enhanced with route information in popups
- **Route lines:** Color-coded and clearly visible
- **Checkpoints:** Numbered markers with detailed package information

## ðŸ”„ Route Updates

### Automatic Updates
- Routes regenerate when packages are added/removed
- Real-time updates as vehicles move
- Automatic optimization when "Show Routes" is enabled

### Manual Controls
- Toggle routes on/off with the "Routes ON/OFF" button
- Optimize individual vehicle routes from the vehicle drawer
- Bulk optimization from the routing dashboard

## ðŸš› Simulation Integration

The routing system integrates with your existing simulation:
- Routes are calculated before simulation starts
- Vehicles follow the optimized routes during simulation
- Checkpoint completion tracking during delivery

## ðŸ“Š Performance Considerations

### Optimization Tips
1. **Batch route requests** to avoid API limits
2. **Cache routes** until packages change
3. **Use route simplification** for better performance
4. **Monitor API usage** through Mapbox dashboard

### Scalability
- Current implementation handles 10-20 vehicles efficiently
- For larger fleets, consider implementing route caching
- Use Mapbox's batch optimization for 25+ vehicles

## ðŸ”® Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Real-time traffic integration** using Mapbox traffic data
2. **Route optimization algorithms** beyond basic waypoint ordering
3. **Alternative route suggestions** for traffic avoidance
4. **Turn-by-turn navigation** for drivers
5. **Delivery time windows** and constraints
6. **Vehicle capacity optimization**

### Advanced Features
- **Route comparison** showing multiple options
- **Historical route analysis** and performance metrics
- **Driver preferences** and route customization
- **Integration with external logistics APIs**

## ðŸŽ¯ Getting Started

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Add some vehicles** using the "Add Vehicle" section

3. **Add packages** to vehicles using the "Add Packages" section

4. **Navigate to "Routing"** and click "Show Routes"

5. **Click "Optimize All Routes"** to generate delivery paths

6. **Explore the interactive map** with routes and checkpoints

Your FleetLink system now has comprehensive routing capabilities! The routes will show the exact path vehicles need to take through real roads to reach all their delivery destinations efficiently.
